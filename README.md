# Volume Measurement by Ultrasound

The clinical significance of measuring the volume of left ventricle is that this can be used in the assessment of coronary artery diseases with infraction, vavular heart diseases and left ventricular hypertrophy [11].
In theory, if the heart phantom is replaced by a real heart, then the volume of the left ventricle of the real heart can be measured. However, the measurement will indeed be much harder in clinical situation due to several reasons
In order to tackle these difficulties, real-time 3D echocardiography will be used instead of 2D echocardiography in clinical situation. First of all, it is free from IP error because during scanning, the whole objects can be scanned through at different orientations and only the acquisition of a single volume is required, thus there will not be the problems of improper planes to be imaged [9]. Besides, since a large number of cross sections is imaged, ample planes can be taken account for volume calculation (summation of multiplying the appropriate cross-sectional areas with the section thickness) so that the reliance on geometric assumption can be reduced. As a result, GA error will be small.
